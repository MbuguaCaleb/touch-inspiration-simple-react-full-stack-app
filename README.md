**Usage Instructions**

```
Here are the instructions to run this project


(A)As the first fullstack application in react i began by creeating a small api in node and mongo for test purposes
before testing externally with your api.


(The Url for the api and its simple Docs are attached below :

It has the following functions : (1)Create user . edit user .view single user and view all users.


It was a mimic of your api and my intention was to begin with it on test then after edit and list have displayed 
i change the app url to the url which you  gave to us

```
